API test

Author: Alberto Nebot
Review: Deezer

Specs:

Create MiniAPI - RESTful API - JSON-API

1 - Access Resources:

  - Get User by ID: {id} => {id, name, email}
  - Get Song by ID: {id} => {id, name, duration}

2 - Handle Favorites:

  - Return list
  - Add Song
  - Remove Song

Susceptible to upgrades (outputs, attributes, objects). Use MySQL


Proposed Solution:

Micro-framework M*C:
  Controllers: (Specific to the resource)
    BaseController
    Favorites
    Songs
    Users
  Libs:
    API
    Auth
    Database
    Request
    Response
  Models:
    AuthModel
    BaseModel
    ResourcesModel


RESTful specs:

All the call need HEADER Authorization = 123

Available Resources:
  GET    /deezer/users/1 - Return user 1
  GET    /deezer/songs/1 - Return song 1
  GET    /deezer/favorites/1 - Return favorites for user 1
  POST   /deezer/favorites/ - Add song to favorite.
    - Please send in the body: i.e. {"song_id": "3"}
    - User comes from token
  DELETE /deezer/favorites/ - Delete song from favorite.
    - Please send in the body: i.e. {"song_id": "3"}
    - User comes from token

To add a new resource:
  Insert in the table resources a new row
  - name. Name of the resource.
  - method. Available method
  - action. Action dispatched by this method
  - format. Accepted format
  - query_field. In case that you want to filter by any field.

  Create a controller with the name of the resource. Or just add the required action to the Basecontroller.
